# Malbench
Malbench is a command-line tool for testing and evaluating the effectiveness of malware detection tools - such as antivirus solutions. It does this by running a set of malware executables against a machine with the detection software installed, and checking if the executable is detected as malicious by that detection tool. Malbench is built to be modular and configurable, so it can be customized to meet the specific needs of different users and environments.

## Why Test and Evaluate Malware Detection Tools with Malbench?
Malware is a common threat to computer security and can cause significant damage if left undetected. Malware detection tools are an essential component of any computer security strategy, but they are not foolproof. Malware authors constantly develop new techniques to evade detection, and it is essential to regularly test and evaluate the effectiveness of detection tools to ensure that they are keeping up with these evolving threats.

Malbench can be leveraged by test many known malware samples against by a detection software you wish to evaluate. This can be done by automatically launching multiple malware payloads at the system and seeing what samples were detected and which ones were evaded. With Malbench, users can customize their testing to meet their specific needs, selecting the malware samples they want to test and the duration.

## Disclaimer 
**âš  Warning**: Malbench is designed to run malicious code that can harm your computer. Malbench should only be run on secure and isolated environments by users who know what they are doing. Do **not** run Malbench on a computer or network that contains sensitive information or data that you are not willing to lose or become compromised. By downloading and/or using this software, you acknowledge and understand the risks of using this software; and assume full responsibility for any damages that may result from running Malbench.

## Installation
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/youkergav/Malbench.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd malbench
    ```
3.  Install the required dependencies using [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):
    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it using the instructions on the official [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

## Usage
To use Malbench, simply run the following command inside your virtual environment:
```bash
python -m malbench /path/to/malware
```

Replace `/path/to/malware` with your `path` argument. The `path` argument should be the path to the malware samples you want to test. This can be either a single file or a folder containing multiple files. Only executable files will be ran by Malbench.

By default, Malbench will show a banner when it starts, and will prompt you to confirm that you understand the risks involved before running the malware samples. You can disable the banner using the `--no-banner` flag, and disable the confirmation prompt using the `--no-warning` flag.

Malware samples are run one by one, and Malbench will wait for each sample to be stopped by the detection software or reach the specified 2 second timeout before moving on to the next sample. This timeout can be changed with the `--timeout` flag. If a sample completes successfully, Malbench will print a red message with a `[-]` prefix, indicating it wasn't stopped by the detection software. If a sample has to be forcibly terminated by the detection software, Malbench will print a green message with a `[+]` prefix, indicating is was successfully detected and stopped.

A full list of arguments to use with Malbench are below.
```bash
usage: malbench [-h] [-v] [-t TIMEOUT] [-nB] [-nW] path

positional arguments:
path file or folder path to the malware samples

optional arguments:
-h, --help show this help message and exit
-v, --verbose prints additional info
-t TIMEOUT, --timeout TIMEOUT
malware TTL before being marked as failure (2 default)
-nB, --no-banner hides the banner logo
-nW, --no-warning Does prompt for user confirmation before running
```
